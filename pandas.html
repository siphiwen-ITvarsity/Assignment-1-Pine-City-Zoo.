                            <h3>PANDAS</h3>
    <p>The giant panda, also known as the panda bear, is a bear native to South Central China. It is characterised by its bold black-and-white coat and rotund body. The name "giant panda" is sometimes used to distinguish it from the red panda, a neighboring musteloid.</p>
    <p>Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo. They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating. They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.</p>
   <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
    <p>You will find the Pandas at pen D10, right next to the Monkey Trails.</p>
